# Preparing for the CIML Summer Institute

**SESSION:** 0_preparation

## Instructions:
You will get the most out of the CIML Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before the event, you’ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to machine learning.

This section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Expanse, to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks

##  HPC Systems Accounts: <a name="accounts"></a>
You will need a training account to access SDSC’s Expanse HPC system for the CIML Institute. We will be creating this account for you. 

An email will be sent from consult@sdsc.edu with the subject line "CIML 2024 Summer Institute: Account Set-Up" that will include your training account username and password and instructions.
We will send this email in time for  "Prep Day," where we will be covering how to manage your training account, along with other useful information. 

As a reminder, we are asking all attendees to use the training accounts that we are providing, even if you already have your own account. This will minimize problems related to custom configurations (e.g. environment variables, choice of shell, etc.) that may cause some of the hands-on examples to break. 

This training account may be used:
  * Via SSH directly to login.expanse.sdsc.edu
  * Via a special page on the Expanse Portal: https://portal.expanse.sdsc.edu/training
  * * For this institute, please do not use portal.expanse.sdsc.edu.
