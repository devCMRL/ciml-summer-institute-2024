### Reading and Presentations:
* **Lecture material:**
   * Presentation Slides: [GPU Computing - Hardware Architecture and Software Infrastructure](./CIML-SI24-GPU-Computing.pdf)
* **Source Code/Examples:** [Nvidia CUDA Samples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/cuda-samples)

### TASKS:

We will log into an Expanse GPU node, compile and test some examples from the Nvidia CUDA samples.

### Log into Expanse, get onto a shared GPU node, and load required modules

First, log onto Expanse using your `train` training account. You can do this either via the Expanse user portal or simply using ssh:
```
ssh trainXXX@login.expanse.sdsc.edu
```

Next we will use the alias for the `srun` command that is defined in your `.bashrc` file to access a single GPU on a shared GPU node:
```
srun-gpu-shared
```

Once we are on a GPU node, we load the default modules for the GPU nodes to gain access to the GPU software stack. We will also load the CUDA toolkit:
```
module reset
module load cuda12.2/toolkit
module list
```
You should see following output
```

Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) shared            3) slurm/expanse/23.02.7   5) DefaultModules
  2) gpu/0.17.3b (g)   4) sdsc/1.0                6) cuda12.2/toolkit/12.2.2

  Where:
   g:  built natively for Intel Skylake

```

We can use the `nvidia-smi` command to check for available GPUs and which processes are running on the GPU.
```
nvidia-smi
```
You should have a single V100 GPU available and there should be no processes running:

### Copy the Nvidia CUDA samples into your home directory

We will first copy the Nvidia CUDA samples from the shared CIML Summer Institute Data directory. If we work in the home directory, then this operation will take a few minutes, in particular if there are many participants copying the data at the same time, as there are many files to copy. You can try to do this in the home directory to see how much time it takes.

Instead of using the home directory we will use the node-local scratch directory. Data in this directory will be purged upon job completion but this is OK as we do not need to retain the toolkit samples. Working in the the scratch directory will be very fast. This is also important when you operate with datasets and/or have heavy I/O during your ML applications.
```
cd /scratch/$USER/job_$SLURM_JOB_ID
tar xvf $CIML24_DATA_DIR/cuda-samples-v12.2.tar.gz
```
You can look into the data directory to see if there other samples that are of interest to you. The CUDA samples have been obtained from [Nvidia's Github repository](https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples).

We are now ready to look at the CUDA samples.
It can be instructive to look at the source code if you want to learn about CUDA.


### Compile and run the `deviceQuery` CUDA sample

The first sample we will look at is `device_query`. This is a utility that demonstrates how to query Nvidia GPU properties. It often comes in handy to check information on the GPU that you have available.

First, we check that we have an appropriate NVIDIA CUDA compiler available. The CUDA samples require at least version 11.7. Because we loaded the CUDA Toolkit module above, we should have the `nvcc` compiler available:
```
nvcc --version
```
should give the following output
```
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2023 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Tue_Aug_15_22:02:13_PDT_2023
Cuda compilation tools, release 12.2, V12.2.140
Build cuda_12.2.r12.2/compiler.33191640_0
```

We have version 12.2 installed so we are good to go. 
We can now move into the `device_query` source directory and compile the code with the `make` command.
```
cd cuda-samples-12.2/Samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery
make
```

You now should have an executable `deviceQuery` in the directory. If you execute it: 
```
./deviceQuery
```
you should see an output with details about the GPU that is available. In our case on Expanse it is a Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB GPU:
```
./deviceQuery Starting...

### Compile and run the matrix multiplication

It is instructive to look at two different matrix multiplication examples and compare the performance.

First we will look at a hand-written matrix multiplication. This implementation features several performance optimizations such as minimize data transfer from GPU RAM to the GPU processors and increase floating point performance.
```
cd cuda-samples-12.2/Samples/0_Introduction/matrixMul
make
```
We now have the executable `matrixMul` available. If we execute it,
```
./matrixMul
```
a matrix multiplication will be performed and the performance reported
```
[Matrix Multiply Using CUDA] - Starting...
GPU Device 0: "Volta" with compute capability 7.0

MatrixA(320,320), MatrixB(640,320)
Computing result using CUDA Kernel...
done
Performance= 2796.59 GFlop/s, Time= 0.047 msec, Size= 131072000 Ops, WorkgroupSize= 1024 threads/block
Checking computed result for correctness: Result = PASS

NOTE: The CUDA Samples are not meant for performance measurements. Results may vary when GPU Boost is enabled.
```

### Compile and run matrix multiplication with CUBLAS library

Finally, let us look at a matrix multiplication that uses Nvidia's CUBLAS library, which is a highly optimized version of the Basic Linear Algebra System for Nvidia GPUs.
```
cd cuda-samples-12.2/Samples/4_CUDA_Libraries/matrixMulCUBLAS
make
```
If we run the executable
```
./matrixMulCUBLAS
```
we should get following output:
```
[Matrix Multiply CUBLAS] - Starting...
GPU Device 0: "Volta" with compute capability 7.0

GPU Device 0: "Tesla V100-SXM2-32GB" with compute capability 7.0

MatrixA(640,480), MatrixB(480,320), MatrixC(640,320)
Computing result using CUBLAS...done.
Performance= 7032.97 GFlop/s, Time= 0.028 msec, Size= 196608000 Ops
Computing result using host CPU...done.
Comparing CUBLAS Matrix Multiply with CPU results: PASS

NOTE: The CUDA Samples are not meant for performance measurements. Results may vary when GPU Boost is enabled.
```

How does the performance compare to the hand written (but optimized) matrix multiplication?
